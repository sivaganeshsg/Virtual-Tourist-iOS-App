# Virtual-Tourist-iOS-App
Tour the world without leaving the comforts of your couch! This app allows you to drop pins on a map and pull up Flickr images associated with that location. The app will store the locations and images using Core Data. Uses Core Data Stack, NSFetchedResultsController for loading images in Collection View.
